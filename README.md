# task-tracker
My personal CLI tool to track day-to-day tasks


## Setup

After cloning, run
```sh
npm install -g .
```
After installing required modules, run the below command with the directory path to hold all your task files in the future.
```sh
export ./setup.sh <PATH/To/DIRECTORY>
```
(*This can be modified in the future*)
